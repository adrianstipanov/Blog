I have a hard time letting go of the fact that yet another decade has gone by.

Two reasons come to mind as to why I feel this way. I don't know whether it was supposed to be the decade that defines my twenties or because I simply haven't accomplished as much as I would have loved to.

I turn 28 next year, so with respect to the first reason I still have time, or so I tell myself. Regarding the second I have no excuse. What bothers me most actually is not that I haven't done as much as I would have liked — what makes me unsettled is the thought of not taking enough risk. Risk is in the beholder's eye of course. Yet in my eyes, I have not taken nearly enough.

In finance, there is the concept of risk premium which basically says that if you are willing to invest in an asset with more risk, you should be compensated for that. The market does not care about how hard you work; it only compensates you for the risk you are taking.

Yet in life, we think that if we work hard enough, we will be compensated accordingly. Unfortunately, that does not always work.

We progressed as a society because, at some point or another, someone, at the risk of being laughed off or losing everything, took a chance on something. It is true that it takes hard work to do it, but before you put yourself in that position you have to take a chance on it.

There is an easy way to find out if you're taking enough risk in your life. Ask yourself "Am I worried?", and if you're not worried, it means you are not risking enough. I am not talking about paranoia here — but just a healthy dose of worry. Being worried doesn't have to have the bad reputation it has acquired. Are you too comfortable and not enough challenged, both professionally, but more importantly personally? Think about that.

"The slower we move the faster we die", said Ryan Bingham in the movie "Up in the Air".

Back to regrets. Had I taken more chances and failed, I would have probably felt better about myself. Some people say failure is overrated. I think those people never failed in their lives. I personally learned a lot from my failures; mine were of omission. It was the failure to act; the failure to place big bets; the failure to play for meaningful stakes. These are all metaphors, by the way, and unless you are Ed Thorp, don't gamble your life in a casino.

"You can't judge a decision by how it turns out, only by whether it made sense given the information available at the time", wrote Tim Geithner, referring to the decisions he had taken during the 07'-'08 financial crisis. It is too easy to go back and think about what "could've and should've been done", but you are doing yourself no good.

Physics aside — time runs forward, and boy, it runs fast. So I am going to invite _risk_ over to dinner this Christmas. I hope we can become lifetime friends.
