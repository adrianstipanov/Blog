When I lived in London, once in a while, I used to go to Speakers’ Corner in Hyde Park – an open-air gathering where people discuss and debate ideas. Even though the kind of things that are being debated there today are not as thought-provoking as during the times when George Orwell was frequenting the corner, there is something there that you won’t find in the digital medium. No titles – that is. No “verified” blue ticks. No likes and no followers. Your worth is measured by the quality of words coming out of your mouth. (And by looks – as much as we don’t like to admit it – we judge people by their appearances.)

Today my “corner” is mostly Twitter. Among others, I follow a few investors and portfolio managers to see what their takes on the markets are. As many of you probably do, I follow most of them because I agree with their viewpoints and their job titles give credibility to what they say. 

The problem here is that this leads to confirmation bias. What happened to the idea that what people say is the only validation you need in assessing the value of an argument? The solution is to do something that mentally feels uncomfortable. That is to follow and talk to people that you disagree with and even try to follow people that use pseudonyms instead of their real names. Would you dismiss a great insight just because it was written by a profile with the name [StockCats](https://twitter.com/StockCats)?

Another problem with the “blue ticks” and high-status jobs is that they give the impression that they hold the truth. That is not the case. 

“Stick to football” is the proverbial reply you will hear whenever a footballer tries to state their opinion on matters other than football. The meaning here is that one is not supposed to opinionate on something one is not an expert on. This is also wrong. 

During the past few weeks, I have seen this type of exchange on many different topics – especially coming from the *experts* addressing the *plebs*. Since it’s a free world out there, people from all walks of life have been expressing themselves on the virus outbreak, the lockdowns, the economy, and even the oil price going negative. The *blue ticks* spoke out almost in unison, calling out everyone who purported to know something on the subject. Socrates said that “the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing,” yet, I am afraid, these *experts* forget about this simple idea. 

We are all suffering from the focusing illusion, we give too much importance to the things **we** are thinking about and fail to observe the whole picture. The only way I see to avoid this is to never stop questioning the experts, the rule, and most importantly – yourself.
